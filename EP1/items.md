### UN 01 - Wire
A wire with parts of its metal exposed, once a component of the UD-171 camera. <br>

Rumors tell of someone who found such a cold cable deep in their closet.

### UN 02 - Security Badge
The pride of security officers, the embossed shield still carries the dignity of bygone days, while the blood-stained cracks narrate past tragedies.  <br>
Twenty-two years ago, the shadow of K.O.S. crept in, spreading despair and death to every corner.  <br>
Amidst chaos and violence, a watchful eye quietly blossomed on the shield. 

### ~UN 03 - Scratched brick~
~A brick made of high-polymer, light yet sturdy, is the most common building material in this city.~ <br>
~On the surface of the brick, there are some scratches and signs of damage. What madness and despair must have driven a soul to tear down a wall futilely?~ <br>
~Perhaps it's an illusion, but this brick feels heavier than others.~
> Based on feedback from others, it is a relatively simple description and may lack enough gameplay or narrative appeal. Perhaps it could be removed or redesigned to make it more unique and engaging. I will change it.

### UN 04 - Medical Drones
The MD-34 drones stand by in silence. These messengers are scattered throughout every corner of the city, equipped with life-support gear and emergency medicine. <br> 
They soar between cityscapes, reaching accident sites with unmatched speed and precision. <br>
Undoubtedly, they are the protectors of countless lives in this city.

In the face of great misfortune, people found themselves unable to cry.

### UN 07 - Implanted Tracker
A micro-device embedded deep within the flesh, the Omninet's delicate tendril reaching into the tangible world. <br>
It monitors breathing and heartbeat in real-time, along with location data, all fed into the network. <br>
Introduced a year ago, the computing center's insufficient processing power still hinders its widespread adoption.

### UN 08 - Watcher Bees
7,000 micro flying robots dispersed throughout the city, equipped with multi-functional sensors, silently weave through crowds. <br>
In Nuovartica, attacking these surveillance bees is considered a serious crime. Yet, residents tormented by SAD spare no effort to hunt and destroy these mechanical sentinels at any cost.
> The Watcher Bees entry has a rich and imaginative style. Based on feedback, it seems that items with similarly vivid descriptions tend to be more engaging. Iâ€™ll be redesigning all other items to align more with this style.

### UN 09 - EMP Remnants
A bomb deployed amidst crowds years ago, instantly crippling all electronic devices within an 800-meter radius. <br>
