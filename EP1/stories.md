## UN A - Shadowless Lamp

After the Third Great Disruption, the immortal cities crumbled into ruins, and once-glorious nations were reduced to remnants and rubble. War, plague, famine, and death swept across the land like tidal waves, consuming life and hope in their path. When the survivors emerged from their hibernation pods, flames of fear danced in their eyes, and the shadow of past sins clung to their souls. Novartica, a city hailed as a celestial sanctuary, stood as humanity’s final beacon, illuminating the path to salvation.

"This city will protect the safety of every resident at all costs." When the White Tower rose from the ruins, this solemn vow transformed into the Omninet, casting its presence over every inch of the city. Drones patrolled the skies above, microphones lay hidden within walls, and infrared cameras and lidar gazed at the most secluded corners. These mechanical guardians tirelessly fulfill their sacred duty to ensure that the sanctity of order remains unblemished. In this eternal light, darkness and sin found no refuge.

Yet the shield of light was not without flaws. Beyond the city’s borders, the boundless wastelands remained shrouded in the endless night of chaos and despair. And so, the White Tower raised its holy flame, proclaiming the advent of the Atlas Project—the light of the Omninet would extend its reach to even farther horizons, spreading the decrees of order to all lands yet untouched by its blessing.

Perhaps even “The One” might awaken once more beneath the radiance of the Omninet.


## UN B - SAD Citizens

**File Number:** LD7894

**Incident Name:** Surge in Surveillance Anxiety Disorder (SAD) Cases

**Incident Overview:** Over the past 30 days, Nuovartica has recorded 78 suspected cases of Surveillance Anxiety Disorder (SAD), with 31 confirmed diagnoses, marking a significant outbreak. Patients typically display an extreme aversion to surveillance devices, accompanied by social withdrawal and destructive tendencies. In one notable case, a middle-aged man suffering from chronic insomnia experienced a mental breakdown. He destroyed multiple electronic devices in his home and attempted to damage municipal infrastructure (a tree trunk) with an axe, searching for hidden surveillance equipment. Secure Sentinel identified the threat within 3.2 seconds and promptly apprehended the individual. The incident resulted in no injuries.

**Assessment:** The reactions of SAD patients stem from an irrational fear of surveillance. The Omninet, as the cornerstone of Nuovartica’s safety and order, remains indispensable. This quarter alone, 462 residents have received timely medical assistance or other critical aid facilitated by real-time monitoring. Under the Omninet’s protection, every resident contributes to a harmonious society. Citizens experiencing unease do not require treatment but rather education and guidance to help them adapt and integrate into this interconnected community.


## UN C - Clear Skies

Dear Rayen,

Recently, my health has improved significantly, and my brother has just received his new organs. I can finally calm down and explain to you what happened that day.

The scene is still vividly etched in my mind. The Ceras aerosol came like a lurking viper, suddenly invading Mak’s body. He collapsed to the ground, clutching his throat with both hands. At that moment, fear pinned me in place, rendering me powerless even to reach out and help him. All I could do was watch as his life seemed to slip away through his fingers. But just when despair overwhelmed me, I heard the hum of drones. They descended from the sky like some miracle. Within mere minutes, Mak was pulled back from the brink of death. Watching him gradually regain his breath, I couldn’t hold back my tears.

Before arriving here, we wandered through countless places, witnessing far too much devastation. I have seen lost travelers in the desert reduced to withered corpses; I have watched petty disputes ignite into blood-soaked massacres; and I have borne witness to the merciless trampling of life by K.O.S. Misfortune is like a poison that corrodes the soul, silently disintegrating humanity into shattered fragments. But now, under the shelter of the White Tower, my brother and I have finally found a place where we can settle down.

I look forward to hearing from you. Take care.

Your forever friend,
Nadya


## UN D - Indices Unexceptional

A revolutionary breakthrough led by the Deep Synapse has been unveiled. Senior Researcher Borien officially announced to the media that predicting violent impulses through the analysis of individual physiological indicators has now become a reality. This technology utilizes high-precision data collected by sensors implanted in residents, including blood pressure, heart rate, hormone levels, sweat production, and vocal fluctuations. Even more strikingly, it deciphers bioelectrical signals and captures the minute movements of facial muscles, unveiling the deeply concealed emotions and intentions of individuals.

The White Tower has given high praise to this innovation and plans to integrate it into the surveillance. By leveraging these sophisticated insights, the system will preemptively correct potential criminal tendencies, neutralize violent behavior at its inception, and deliver a higher standard of security for all citizens.

In a calm yet confident tone, Borien addressed the media: "This time, we are not merely monitoring physiological indicators but delving into the hidden currents within the human mind. In this era of rapid technological advancement, the fragility of the human body is magnified. Each wields immense technological power, and even the briefest impulse could unleash irreversible consequences..."

## UN E - The Late Night Visitor

On a quiet evening in District IV, officers from Secure Sentinel knocked on a door. Milo Thatch was seated at her family dinner table when she was escorted from the house for allegedly uttering dangerous remarks.

"Ensuring the safety of this city is our unshakable duty," explained Officer Logan Pierce, who was on patrol that night. After dinner, Ms. Thatch mentioned plans to attack a convenience store. This statement triggered an alert in our surveillance system. Based on preventive principles, we had to intervene and take necessary action."

Milo was treated respectfully throughout the process. After receiving appropriate guidance and education, she was safely returned to her home. Such preemptive intervention holds immeasurable value for public safety. It targets not just citizens like Mrs. Thatch, who may accidentally make imprudent remarks, but also effectively deters potential severe criminal activities such as robbery or even murder.
