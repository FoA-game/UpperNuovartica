## UN A - Shadowless Lamp

After the Third Great Disruption, survivors live in reverence, ever mindful that the shadows of war, disease, hunger, and death continue to linger. Nuovartica, hailed as the only paradise, stands as the final salvation of human civilization.

"This city will protect the safety of every resident at all costs." From the moment the White Tower declared the city complete, the Omninet became its omniscient eyes. Drones silently patrol the skies while microphones lie hidden within the walls. Even the most secluded corners cannot escape the relentless surveillance of infrared cameras and laser radars. These mechanical guardians, tireless in their watch, fulfill their sacred duty to ensure that the sanctity of order remains unblemished. In this eternal light, darkness and sin have nowhere to hide.

Yet, the shield of protection remains incomplete. Across this continent, other cities continue to struggle in chaos and fear, yearning for refuge and salvation. As part of the Atlas Project, the White Tower has proposed the construction of new computing centers to expand the reach of Omninet, extending light to distant horizons and bringing order and safety to those in need. Perhaps, even to awaken The One from within the Omninet.

## UN B - SAD Citizens

**File Number:** LD7894

**Incident Name:** Surge in Surveillance Anxiety Disorder (SAD) Cases

**Incident Overview:** Over the past 30 days, Nuovartica has recorded 78 suspected cases of Surveillance Anxiety Disorder (SAD), with 31 confirmed diagnoses, marking a significant outbreak. Patients typically display an extreme aversion to surveillance devices, accompanied by social withdrawal and destructive tendencies. In one notable case, a middle-aged man suffering from chronic insomnia experienced a mental breakdown. He destroyed multiple electronic devices in his home and attempted to damage municipal infrastructure (a tree trunk) with an axe, searching for hidden surveillance equipment. Secure Sentinel identified the threat within 3.2 seconds and promptly apprehended the individual. The incident resulted in no injuries.

**Assessment:** The reactions of SAD patients stem from an irrational fear of surveillance. The Omninet, as the cornerstone of Nuovartica’s safety and order, remains indispensable. This quarter alone, 462 residents have received timely medical assistance or other critical aid facilitated by real-time monitoring. Under the Omninet’s protection, every resident contributes to a harmonious society. Citizens experiencing unease do not require treatment but rather education and guidance to help them adapt and integrate into this interconnected community.


## UN C - Clear Skies

Dear Rayen,

Recently, my health has improved significantly, and my brother has just received his new organs. I can finally calm down and explain to you what happened that day.

The scene is still vividly etched in my mind. The Ceras aerosol came like a lurking viper, suddenly invading Mak’s body. He collapsed to the ground, clutching his throat with both hands. At that moment, fear pinned me in place, rendering me powerless even to reach out and help him. All I could do was watch as his life seemed to slip away through his fingers. But just when despair overwhelmed me, I heard the hum of drones. They descended from the sky like some miracle. Within mere minutes, Mak was pulled back from the brink of death. Watching him gradually regain his breath, I couldn’t hold back my tears.

Before arriving here, we wandered through countless places, witnessing far too much devastation. Misfortune, like corrosive venom, had reduced humanity to fragments. But now, under the shelter of the White Tower, my brother and I have finally found a place where we can settle down.

I look forward to hearing from you. Take care.

Your forever friend,
Nadya


## UN D - Indices Unexceptional

A revolutionary breakthrough led by the Deep Synapse has been unveiled. Senior Researcher Borien officially announced to the media that predicting violent impulses through the analysis of individual physiological indicators has now become a reality. This technology utilizes high-precision data collected by sensors implanted in residents, including blood pressure, heart rate, hormone levels, sweat production, and vocal fluctuations. Even more strikingly, it deciphers bioelectrical signals and captures the minute movements of facial muscles, unveiling the deeply concealed emotions and intentions of individuals.

The White Tower has given high praise to this innovation and plans to integrate it into the surveillance. By leveraging these sophisticated insights, the system will preemptively correct potential criminal tendencies, neutralize violent behavior at its inception, and deliver a higher standard of security for all citizens.

In a calm yet confident tone, Borien addressed the media: "This time, we are not merely monitoring physiological indicators but delving into the hidden currents within the human mind. In this era of rapid technological advancement, the fragility of the human body is magnified. Each wields immense technological power, and even the briefest impulse could unleash irreversible consequences..."

## UN E - The Late Night Visitor

On a quiet evening in District IV, officers from Secure Sentinel knocked on a door. Milo Thatch was seated at her family dinner table when she was escorted from the house for allegedly uttering dangerous remarks.

"Ensuring the safety of this city is our unshakable duty," explained Officer Logan Pierce, who was on patrol that night. After dinner, Ms. Thatch mentioned plans to attack a convenience store. This statement triggered an alert in our surveillance system. Based on preventive principles, we had to intervene and take necessary action."

Milo was treated respectfully throughout the process. After receiving appropriate guidance and education, she was safely returned to her home. Such preemptive intervention holds immeasurable value for public safety. It targets not just citizens like Mrs. Thatch, who may accidentally make imprudent remarks, but also effectively deters potential severe criminal activities such as robbery or even murder.
