## UN A - Shadowless Lamp

After the Third Great Disruption, the immortal cities crumbled into ruins, and once-glorious nations were reduced to remnants and rubble. War, plague, famine, and death swept across the land like tidal waves, consuming life and hope in their path. When the survivors emerged from their hibernation pods, flames of fear danced in their eyes, and the shadow of past sins clung to their souls. Nuovartica, a city hailed as a celestial sanctuary, stood as humanity’s final beacon, illuminating the path to salvation.

"This city will protect every life at all costs." When the White Tower rose from the ruins, this solemn vow transformed into the Omninet, casting its presence over every inch of the city. Drones patrolled the skies above, microphones lay hidden within walls, and infrared cameras and lidar gazed at the most secluded corners. These mechanical guardians tirelessly fulfill their sacred duty to ensure that the sanctity of order remains unblemished. In this eternal light, darkness and sin found no refuge.

Yet the shield of light was not without flaws. Beyond the city’s borders, the boundless wastelands remained shrouded in the endless night of chaos and despair. And so, the White Tower raised its holy flame, proclaiming the advent of the Atlas Project—the light of the Omninet would extend its reach to even farther horizons, spreading the decrees of order to all lands yet untouched by its blessing.

Perhaps even “The One” might awaken once more beneath the radiance of the Omninet.


## UN B - SAD Citizens

**File Number:** LD7894

**Incident Name:** Surge in Surveillance Anxiety Disorder (SAD) Cases

**Incident Overview:** Over the past 30 days, Nuovartica has recorded 78 suspected cases of Surveillance Anxiety Disorder (SAD), with 31 confirmed diagnoses, marking a significant outbreak. Patients typically display an extreme aversion to surveillance devices, accompanied by social withdrawal and destructive tendencies. In one notable case, a middle-aged man suffering from chronic insomnia experienced a mental breakdown. He destroyed multiple electronic devices in his home and attempted to damage municipal infrastructure (a tree trunk) with an axe, searching for hidden surveillance equipment. Secure Sentinel identified the threat within 3.2 seconds and promptly apprehended the individual. The incident resulted in no injuries.

**Assessment:** The behavior of SAD patients has been classified as an irrational fear of the Omninet's surveillance. As the foundation of this city's safety and order, the value of the Omninet is beyond question: in this quarter alone, 462 citizens have received timely medical assistance or other forms of support thanks to real-time monitoring.  Regrettably, the presence of the uneasy is a source of lament. Their anxiety does not stem from flaws in the surveillance system but from their inability to adapt to this advanced framework. For these distressed individuals, traditional treatment may not be the optimal solution. What is truly needed is deeper education and guidance to help them to integrate into this tightly interconnected community.


## UN C - Clear Skies

Dear Rayen,

Recently, my health has improved greatly, and my brother has just received his new organs. At last, I can calm myself enough to recount what happened that dreadful day.

I can still see it as though it were unfolding before me. The Ceras aerosol crept in, silent and venomous, striking Mak like a serpent coiled in darkness. He fell to his knees, clawing at his throat with desperation. In that moment, terror rooted me to the spot—I lacked even the strength to reach for him. Helplessly, I watched as his life ebbed away, slipping grain by grain, like sand through fingers. And then, just when despair seemed ready to devour me whole, I heard the low hum of drones descending from the distant sky.  In mere minutes, Mak was wrested back from the abyss. As I watched his breath slowly return to him, tears—hot, bitter, and relentless—spilled freely from my eyes.

Before arriving here, we wandered from place to place, witnessing far too much devastation. I have seen lost travelers in the desert reduced to lifeless husks; I have watched trivial disputes ignite into bloody massacres; I have even witnessed the unfeeling cruelty with which K.O.S. trampled upon life. Misfortune is not merely an external force—it is a poison that seeps into the soul. But now, under the shelter of the White Tower, my brother and I have finally found a place where we can settle down.

I await your reply with a heart both heavy and hopeful. May you find peace under the same sky that now shelters us.

Your always, <br>
Nadya


## UN D - Indices Unexceptional

A revolutionary breakthrough led by the Deep Synapse has been unveiled. Senior Researcher Borien officially announced to the media that predicting violent impulses through the analysis of individual physiological indicators has now become a reality. This technology utilizes high-precision data collected by sensors implanted in residents, including blood pressure, heart rate, hormone levels, sweat production, and vocal fluctuations. Even more strikingly, it deciphers bioelectrical signals and captures the minute movements of facial muscles, unveiling the deeply concealed emotions and intentions of individuals.

The White Tower has given high praise to this innovation and plans to integrate it into the surveillance. By leveraging these sophisticated insights, the system will preemptively correct potential criminal tendencies, neutralize violent behavior at its inception, and deliver a higher standard of security for all citizens.

In a calm yet confident tone, Borien addressed the media: "This time, we are not merely monitoring physiological indicators but delving into the hidden currents within the human mind. In this era of rapid technological advancement, the fragility of the human body is magnified. Each wields immense technological power, and even the briefest impulse could unleash irreversible consequences..."

## UN E - The Late Night Visitor

On a quiet evening in District IV, officers from Secure Sentinel knocked on a door. Milo Thatch was seated at her family dinner table when she was escorted from the house for allegedly uttering dangerous remarks.

"Ensuring the safety of this city is our unshakable duty," explained Officer Logan Pierce, who was on patrol that night. After dinner, Ms. Thatch mentioned plans to attack a convenience store. This statement triggered an alert in our surveillance system. Based on preventive principles, we had to intervene and take necessary action."

Milo was treated respectfully throughout the process. After receiving appropriate guidance and education, she was safely returned to her home. Such preemptive intervention holds immeasurable value for public safety. It targets not just citizens like Mrs. Thatch, who may accidentally make imprudent remarks, but also effectively deters potential severe criminal activities such as robbery or even murder.
