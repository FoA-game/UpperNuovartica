## UN A - Shadowless Lamp

After the Third Great Disruption, survivors live in reverence, ever mindful that the shadows of war, disease, hunger, and death continue to linger. Nuovartica, hailed as the only paradise, stands as the final salvation of human civilization.

“This city will protect the safety of every resident at all costs.” From the moment the White Tower declared the city complete, the "Omninet" became its omniscient eyes. Drones silently patrol the skies while microphones lie hidden within the walls. Even the most secluded corners cannot escape the relentless surveillance of infrared cameras and laser radars. These mechanical guardians, tireless in their watch, carry out their sacred duty to ensure that the sanctity of order remains unblemished. In this eternal light, darkness and sin have nowhere to hide.

Yet, beneath this omnipresent gaze, a clandestine yearning begins to take root. Even as light pervades every inch of the city, some seek shadows to conceal their secrets. Under the watchful eye of the Omninet, an unknown question quietly emerges: what is left of freedom when every breath is observed?

## UN B - SAD Citizens

Recently, Nuovartica has been afflicted once again by cases of Surveillance Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Several residents have succumbed to an irrational fear of surveillance devices, choosing isolation over venturing beyond their doorsteps. A man, tormented by sleepless nights, in a desperate act, destroyed most electronic devices within his home and around the neighborhood. The surveillance system apprehended him as he was frantically chopping at tree trunks with an axe, attempting to find internal cables.

It must be understood that the discomfort experienced by those with SAD may simply be nostalgia for a more chaotic and unstructured past. Our omnipresent monitoring exists for the welfare of every citizen. Real-time surveillance ensures we can offer immediate assistance to anyone in need, from lost children to the elderly requiring urgent medical care. Statistics reveal that this quarter alone, 462 individuals have had their lives saved thanks to timely intervention.

To those who voice concerns over SAD, perhaps a reassessment of their stance is in order. Under the protection of the Omninet, personal privacy has evolved into a collective responsibility. We are no longer isolated entities but tightly-knit community members. Instead of being treated, those citizens who feel uneasy need education and guidance to better integrate into the harmonious society that we all maintain together.


## UN C - Racing to the Sea

Dear Council Colleagues,

We find ourselves at a pivotal moment in history, jointly witnessing a critical decision in Nuovartica's path toward future development—the successful approval of the Arcadix Dam project. As the first step of the grand Atlas Project, this project promises to supply our city with a relentless stream of electricity, fully catering to Nuovartica's escalating energy demands.

Simultaneously, establishing a new computing center near the dam is set to boost Omninet's computational capacity significantly. The old computing center beneath the White Tower once celebrated as a technological wonder, is now overwhelmed. In this new facility, the vigorous flow of water will act as the heart of a supercomputer cooling system that ensures the vast ocean of digital remains untouched by the scorching realities of heat.

With an abundant supply of electricity, an efficient water cooling system, and a cutting-edge computing center at our disposal, we stand before thrilling prospects—including the potential awakening of The One from within the Omninet. Even if this goal remains out of reach, the upgrade of the Omninet signifies our capability to process vast amounts of data and execute more complex algorithms. This advancement provides Nuovartica with more comprehensive and meticulous surveillance, fortifying an unbreakable barrier for the city's security.


## UN D - Indices Unexceptional

Senior Researcher Borien from the Deep Synapse Institute has unveiled a groundbreaking advancement in the realm of behavioral physiology—predicting individual violent impulses through a comprehensive analysis of physiological indicators. Nowadays, sensors implanted in residents can already monitor details like blood pressure, heart rate, hormone levels, sweat production, and vocal tremors. Building on this, Borien has harnessed bioelectrical signals to capture the minute movements of facial muscles. Through all these physiological phenomena, this technology leaves no room for humans' deeply concealed emotions and intentions to hide.

Championed by the White Tower, this innovation is poised for integration into Omninet's extensive surveillance architecture. Through this data insight, Omninet aims to preempt potential criminals, stifle malevolence before it can bloom, and bestow unparalleled security upon the citizenry.

With a calm and firm tone, Borien told the media, "This time, we are not just detecting the physiological indicators of citizens but also delving into the undercurrents within the mind. In this era of advanced technology, the fragility of the human body is magnified. Each individual wields immense technological power, and even a momentary impulse can lead to irreversible consequences in a moment of loss of control..."

## UN E - The Late Night Visitor

On a quiet night in District IV, officers from Secure Sentinel knocked on a door, removing Mrs. Milo Thatch from the comfort of her home as she spread dangerous rhetoric at the dinner table.

"Prevention is always better than remedy," said Officer Logan Pierce, who was on duty that night. "Mrs. Thatch carelessly broadcasted intentions to attack a convenience store, triggering our surveillance system's alert. We had to intervene as a precaution." 

Mrs. Thatch was not treated harshly and was allowed to return home after appropriate guidance and education. Such preemptive intervention holds immeasurable value for public safety. It targets not just well-meaning citizens like Mrs. Thatch, who may accidentally make imprudent remarks, but also effectively deters potential severe criminal activities such as robbery or even murder.
